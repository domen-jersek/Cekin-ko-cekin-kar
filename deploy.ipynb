    "Progress update: I adjusted Fly.io config for a worker app (no HTTP), added a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy on push, and pushed the changes. Next, I’ll give you step-by-step instructions to deploy for free with Fly.io or Koyeb and how to set secrets safely.Let’s get you deployed for free. I’ll set up an automated path and give you step‑by‑step manual options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "- Make Fly.io config suitable for a worker app (no HTTP) and add CI for one-click deploys.\n",
    "- Provide Fly.io deployment steps (manual and via GitHub Actions).\n",
    "- Provide Koyeb alternative (also free) using the existing Dockerfile.\n",
    "- Verify local basics and point out secrets you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I changed just now\n",
    "- Updated fly.toml to remove the HTTP service and treat the bot as a worker. This prevents failing health checks.\n",
    "- Added GitHub Actions `Deploy to Fly.io` workflow at fly-deploy.yml to deploy on push.\n",
    "- Pushed everything to `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option A: Fly.io (free-ish, smoothest with our new CI)\n",
    "\n",
    "What you’ll need:\n",
    "- Fly.io account and CLI (or just use the GitHub Actions flow).\n",
    "- A Fly app name (change `app` in fly.toml or let `fly launch` set one).\n",
    "- Secrets: DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, SPREADSHEET_ID, SHEET_NAME, CEKINCKI_ROLE_PREFIX, SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS, NOTIFY_* (optional), and GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways to deploy:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A1) Deploy via GitHub Actions (recommended)\n",
    "- In your GitHub repo settings:\n",
    "  - Add a repository secret `FLY_API_TOKEN` (create this from Fly: account settings -> tokens).\n",
    "- Push to `master` (already wired).\n",
    "  - The workflow fly-deploy.yml will run `flyctl deploy --remote-only` and publish the app.\n",
    "- Set Fly secrets once (run these locally with Fly CLI or in a Codespace — the CI doesn’t set app secrets):\n",
    "  - After logging in to Fly, set secrets on the app. For PowerShell, use single quotes for the JSON:\n",
    "    - DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, SPREADSHEET_ID, SHEET_NAME, CEKINCKI_ROLE_PREFIX (e.g., “Cekinčki:”), SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS, NOTIFY_*.\n",
    "    - GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON: paste your Service Account JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: You can also set secrets from the Fly web UI if using Launchpad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2) Manual deploy from your machine\n",
    "- Install Fly CLI and login (once).\n",
    "- In repo root:\n",
    "  - Initialize app if needed: fly launch --no-deploy\n",
    "  - Set secrets:\n",
    "    - DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, SPREADSHEET_ID, SHEET_NAME, CEKINCKI_ROLE_PREFIX, SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS, NOTIFY_*.\n",
    "    - GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON (paste entire JSON).\n",
    "  - Deploy:\n",
    "    - fly deploy\n",
    "  - Watch logs:\n",
    "    - fly logs\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- We intentionally removed `http_service` in fly.toml as this bot doesn’t expose HTTP. That’s correct for a long‑running worker.\n",
    "- Make sure your Google Sheet is shared with the service account email.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option B: Koyeb (free tier, repo deploy with Dockerfile)\n",
    "- Go to Koyeb, create a new service from GitHub, pick this repository.\n",
    "- It’ll build using your Dockerfile.\n",
    "- Set environment variables in Koyeb’s dashboard:\n",
    "  - DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, SPREADSHEET_ID, SHEET_NAME, CEKINCKI_ROLE_PREFIX, SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS, NOTIFY_*.\n",
    "  - GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON: paste entire JSON.\n",
    "- Deploy and monitor logs in Koyeb.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secrets you’ll need to set\n",
    "- DISCORD_TOKEN\n",
    "- GUILD_ID\n",
    "- SPREADSHEET_ID\n",
    "- SHEET_NAME (e.g., “cekincki”)\n",
    "- CEKINCKI_ROLE_PREFIX (default is “Cekinčki:”)\n",
    "- SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS (e.g., 300)\n",
    "- NOTIFY_ON_CHANGE, NOTIFY_MODE, NOTIFY_CHANNEL_ID, NOTIFY_TEMPLATE (optional)\n",
    "- GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON: Paste the entire service account JSON. Ensure it contains client_email and private_key. Share the sheet with client_email.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional local checks before deploy\n",
    "- Verify credentials file or JSON works:\n",
    "  - npm run check:google\n",
    "  - If this fails, double‑check that your sheet is shared with the service account, and the JSON includes client_email and private_key.\n",
    "- Quick start:\n",
    "  - npm install\n",
    "  - npm start\n",
    "  - Watch the bot log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small heads‑up on matching\n",
    "- The bot maps rows by server display name (nickname). If two members share the same nickname, the first match wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Want me to finish it?\n",
    "If you’d like, I can:\n",
    "- Rename the Fly app in fly.toml and kick off the deploy workflow.\n",
    "- Walk you through setting the Fly secrets (you’ll paste them; I’ll verify with logs).\n",
    "- Do the Koyeb deploy steps and summarize the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me which path you prefer (Fly.io CI/manual or Koyeb), and I’ll drive the exact steps next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Made changes."
